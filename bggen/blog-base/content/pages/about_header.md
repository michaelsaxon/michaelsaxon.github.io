I study generative AI artifacts like LLMs and text-to-image models. I make **meaningful evaluations of new capabilities that are difficult to measure** to improve them.

I am a [Siegel Family Endowment](https://www.siegelendowment.org/) Postdoctoral Fellow in the [Tech Policy Lab](https://techpolicylab.uw.edu/) and [iSchool](https://ischool.uw.edu/people/faculty/profile/mssaxon) at the University of Washington.
I got my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the [University of California, Santa Barbara](http://nlp.cs.ucsb.edu/), advised by Prof. William Yang Wang. I was an NSF Graduate Research Fellow, a Center for Responsible ML Fellow, and a [2024 Rising Star in Generative AI](https://genai-workshop.cs.umass.edu/). I got my M.S. and B.S. in Electrical & Computer Engineering at Arizona State University.
