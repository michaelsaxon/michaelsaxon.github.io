## Academic Geneaology

My advisor [William Wang](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~william/misc.html)'s academic lineage bifurcates in the mid 20th century.
His advisor William Cohen was in turn advised by Alex Borgida, who was advised by Ray Perrault, who had two advisors, Joyce Friedman and William Rounds.
This creates two chains of advisors:

- Joyce Friedman, Harvard 1965
- Hao Wang, Harvard 1948
- Willard Quine, Harvard 1932
- Alfred Whitehead, Harvard 1884
- W. D. Niven, ?
- James Clerk Maxwell, Cambridge 1854
- William Hopkins, Cambridge 1827
- Adam Sedgewick, Cambridge 1811
- Thomas Jones, Cambridge 1779
- Thomas Postlethwaite, Cambridge 1753
- Stephen Whisson, Cambridge 1742
- Walter Taylor, Cambridge 1736
- Robert Smith, Cambridge 1714
- Roger Cotes, Cambridge 1706
- Isaac Newton, Cambridge 1665
- Isaac Barrow, Cambridge 1648
- James Dupont, Cambridge ? 

- William Rounds, Stanford 1968
- Dana Scott, Princeton 1958
- Alonzo Church, Princeton 1927
- Oswald Veblen, University of Chicago 1903
- E. H. Moore, Yale 1885
- H. A. Newton, Yale 1850
- Michel Chasles, Ecole Polytechnique 1814
- Simeon Poisson
- Joseph Lagrange
- Leonhard Euler, Universitt Basel 1726
- Johann Bernoulli, 1694
- Jacob Bernoulli
- Gottfried Leibniz, Universitt Altdorf 1666
- Erhard Weigel, Universitt Leipzig 1650 

Per William Cohen, Alex Borgida, Wikipedia, and the The Mathematics Geneology Project.

Of course, great to be a descendant of Leibniz and Newton, like pretty much everyone else in mathworld (Newton is to academic geneaology in math as Genghis Khan is to biological geneaology in East and Central Asia).

The question mark for W. D. Niven was a bit suspicious to me so I dug deeper:
[Alfred North Whitehead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_North_Whitehead) was educated at Cambridge, not Harvard, and his advisor was [Edward Routh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Routh). 
Edward Routh in turn was advised by William Hopkins, which connects back with the geneaology that was passed down to me.
[W.D. Niven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Davidson_Niven) was one of Whitehead's instructors, but as far as I can tell was not his academic advisor.
Further, Niven was not advised by James Clerk Maxwell, he was instead a colleague and editor of his.
However, James Clerk Maxwell was one of Hopkins's students.

So as much as my Electrical Engineer's heart would love to be an academic great great ... grandchild of Maxwell, I am instead his academic first cousin, nine times removed.

## My Bacon number is 4

I don't know my ErdÅ‘s number, but I do know my [Kevin Bacon number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon#Bacon_numbers), which is 4.
Amusingly, I am on the Bacon graph because, when I was like 7 years old, I appeared in such a bizarre school play that a future YouTuber who also happened to be in the play would later make a video about it.

At YouTube video https://youtu.be/SRWatgS077k?si=FnNWfOa1v9vFejMK&t=312

And this YouTuber ended up being big enough to appear in a big Mr. Beast video, and the Will Smith YouTube rewind from like 2018.

So I can either trace a Bacon line of me `-->` JaidenAnimations `-->` Mr. Beast `-->` Dustin Hoffman (both were in Kung Fu Panda 4) `-->` Kevin Bacon, or `-->` Will Smith `-->` Jeff Goldbum (Independence Day) `-->` Kevin Bacon.

Not sure if it's funnier to go through Mr. Beast or Will Smith.

## Originating a mildly successful meme in college

That's a story for another time.

## The MIKEY emoji

This is a fun one from the UCSB NLP slack.

## Single sentence fun facts

I am a USAF brat.
I chose to play the saxophone in school because of nominative determinism. Then I chose to switch to bassoon because I thought it was a funny looking and sounding instrument and playing saxophone at my band's level was a bit too easy.
I enjoy hobbyist language learning.
I am an Eagle Scout, so if I accomplish anything substantial the BSA will claim me.
